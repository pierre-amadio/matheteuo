The idea is to generate automatically some exercice similar to the [Daily dose of Hebrew](http://dailydoseofhebrew.com/) or  [Daily dose of Greek](https://dailydoseofgreek.com/) videos.

It uses the [Sword library](http://crosswire.org/sword/index.jsp) to access texts, dictionnaries and morphologicals repositories.

The following books are supported:
* [OSHB](http://openscriptures.github.io/morphhb/) : Open Scripture Hebrew Bible
* [MorphGNT](http://morphgnt.org/) : SBL Greek New Testament
* LXX : Septuagint
